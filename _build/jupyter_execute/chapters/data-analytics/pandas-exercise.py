# # Pandas Exercise

# Create a DataFrame by reading file *../../assets/data/Changi_daily_rainfall.csv*. Perform the following two tasks with this DataFrame:

# ## Task 1
# 1. Determine whether the dataframe contains `NaN` values, and if so, populates the `NaN` values with 0.
# 2. View the first 2 rows and the tail 2 rows, and check total length of data.
# 3. Display a summary of the characteristics of the dataframe
# 4. Calculate the number of days with daily rainfall exceeding 50mm.
# 
# Hint: If you complete this task in your local computer (not recommend), please modify the file path accordingly.
