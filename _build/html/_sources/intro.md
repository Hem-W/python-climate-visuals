      This e-book was originally developed for the NUS course
      <a href="https://xiaoganghe.github.io/NUS-CE3201">
        Civil Engineering Analytics and Data Visualization
      </a>.
      </br>
      </br>
      It is a collection of online Jupyter notebooks 
      that explicitly show students how to use Python to perform data analysis and visualization. 
      </br>
      </br>
      You can
      <a href="https://xiaoganghe.github.io/python-climate-visuals">
        view this text online

<div class="container">

    <div class="col-lg-6" style="float:none;align:center;">
      </br>
      This book logo is composed of:
      <ul>
      <li>A skyline (Marina Bay Sands) and a landmark (Merlion) of a gardent city (Singapore);</li>
      <li>An unseen climate change signal revealed by warming stripes illustrating Singapore's historical (1901-2020) temperature;</li>
      <li>A tag line (Python Climate Visuals) along with its acronym (pyCIVIL) indicating book contents and targeted readers.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <a href="https://xiaoganghe.github.io/python-climate-visuals">
        <img src="images/favicon.png" style="width:400px">
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
  </br>
  I hope this logo could raise people's awareness of climate change and spark data-driven ideas to battle against the ongoing climate crisis.
